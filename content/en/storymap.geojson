						"details": "## The Blessed Arrival\r\n\r\nThe scholars of biography and history hold differing views on the precise date of the Prophet's ﷺ birth. However, they are in unanimous agreement that he was born on a **Monday** during the **Year of the Elephant**.\r\n\r\nIbn al-Qayyim stated definitively, \"There is no difference of opinion on the fact that he was born in the middle of Makkah and that it was during the Year of the Elephant.\"\r\n\r\nFurthermore, on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be well pleased with him and his father), it is narrated: \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was born during the Year of the Elephant.\" This is a well-established fact upon which the scholars hold consensus, as reported by Khaleefah ibn Khayyaat, Ibn al-Jazzaar, Ibn Dihiyyah, and Ibn al-Jawzee.\r\n\r\nRegarding his birth on a Monday, it has been narrated on the authority of Abee Qataadah al-Ansaaree (may Allah be well pleased with him) that the Prophet ﷺ was asked about fasting on Mondays, to which he responded:\r\n> **\"That is the day on which I was born, the day on which I was sent on my mission as a Messenger - or the first day on which I received revelation.\"**\r\n\r\nIbn Katheer emphatically stated:\r\n>\"Those who claim that he was born on a Friday, the 17th of Rabee’ al-Awwaal, have greatly erred.\"\r\n\r\nAl-Tabari confirms that Muhammad was born in the Year of Elephant: \r\n> The birth of the Messenger of God took place during the reign of Kisra Anusharwan in the year when Abrahah al-Ashram Abu Yaksum marched against Mecca with the Abyssinians, bringing with him the elephant, having the intention of demolishing the House of God.\r\n## Testimonies and Circumstances\r\n\r\nWhile the exact month and day of his birth remain a point of scholarly discussion, Ibn Ishaaq narrated, based on the accounts of several Companions (may Allah be pleased with them), that they asked the Messenger of Allah ﷺ about himself. He ﷺ replied: **\"I am the prayer of my father [Prophet] Ibraaheem, and the glad tidings from Jesus. When my mother gave birth to me, she saw there was light protruding from her which illuminated the palaces of Al-Shaam.\"** Al-Albaanee graded the chain of narrators for this report as \"very good and strong.\"\r\n\r\nThe birth of the Prophet ﷺ occurred after the passing of his father, Abdullah, while he was still in the womb of his mother. Thus, the Prophet ﷺ grew up as an orphan. Moreover, his birth took place in the house of Abee Taalib, situated in the district of Banee Haashim."

						"details": "Upon the passing of the Messenger of Allah’s ﷺ noble mother, **Aaminah bint Wahb**, when he was **six years of age**, the responsibility of his care was entrusted to his esteemed grandfather, **Abdul-Mutallib ibn Haashim**.\r\n\r\n**Abdul-Mutallib** was a man of great nobility and honor within his community. The Quraysh held him in such high regard that they bestowed upon him the honorable epithet **“al-Fadl”**, recognizing his profound forgiveness and grace. Following the demise of his father, **Haashim ibn Abd Manaaf**, he was appointed to the significant duty of providing sustenance and protection to the pilgrims who journeyed to Makkah.\r\n\r\nA deep and abiding love resided in **Abdul-Mutallib’s** heart for his grandson, Muhammad ﷺ, a love that surpassed even the affection he held for his own children. His compassion and tenderness towards him were more pronounced than towards his own sons.\r\n\r\n**Ibn Ishaaq** eloquently narrated:\r\n\r\n> “The Messenger of Allah ﷺ resided with his grandfather, Abdul-Mutallib ibn Haashim, after the death of his mother, Aaminah bint Wahb. A special mattress would be placed for Abdul-Mutallib in the shade of the Ka’bah. His sons would respectfully sit around it, awaiting his presence. Such was their reverence for him that none dared to sit upon it in his absence. The young Messenger of Allah ﷺ, then a healthy and robust boy, would approach and sit upon his grandfather’s mattress. His uncles would attempt to gently pull at the ends of his turban, trying to dissuade him. However, if Abdul-Mutallib witnessed this, he would interject, saying: **“Leave my son, for by Allah, he has a great matter in his future.”** He would then allow the young Muhammad ﷺ to sit beside him on the mattress, stroking his back with affection and finding pleasure in all that he did.”\r\n\r\n**Abdul-Mutallib’s** care extended to the simplest of acts, for he would never partake in a meal without first uttering: **“My son!”** and ensuring that the young Muhammad ﷺ was also given to eat. When the shadow of death began to loom, **Abdul-Mutallib** offered his profound counsel to **Aboo Taalib**, entrusting him with the crucial responsibility of safeguarding and protecting the Messenger of Allah ﷺ."

						"details": "When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ reached the age of **eight**, a new chapter unfolded in his young life with the passing of his beloved grandfather. As per his grandfather's wise counsel, the Prophet ﷺ was entrusted into the care of his uncle, **Aboo Taalib** (born c. 539), son of ‘Abdul-Muttalib. The bond between the Prophet’s father, Abdullah, and Aboo Taalib was particularly strong, as they shared the same mother. Thus, upon Abdul-Mutallib's demise, the responsibility for the Prophet’s well-being naturally fell to Aboo Taalib.\r\n\r\n**Ibn Sa’d** and **Ibn ‘Asaakir**, among others, narrated on the authority of **Ibn ‘Abbaas** (may Allah be well pleased with them both):\r\n\r\n> “When Abdul-Muttalib passed away, Aboo Taalib took the Messenger of Allah ﷺ to be under his care. Aboo Taalib held him in deep affection, a love that surpassed even that for his own sons. He would not sleep unless the Prophet ﷺ was by his side, and he ensured that food was always set aside for him ﷺ. When Aboo Taalib’s sons would dine together or individually, they made a point of not eating to their full capacity. However, if the Messenger of Allah ﷺ joined them, they would eat until they were completely satisfied. Whenever Aboo Taalib intended to serve them lunch or dinner, he would instruct them: **“Not until my son has arrived.”** Upon the Prophet’s ﷺ arrival, they would all sit together, and Aboo Taalib would offer him food from their portion. If the Prophet ﷺ was absent, he would not allow his own children to eat their fill.\r\n\r\n> Furthermore, if there was milk available, it would be served to the children in a large drinking-bowl. The Prophet ﷺ would drink first, and then the other children would partake from the same bowl, one after another, and be fully satisfied. Yet, if they drank without the Prophet ﷺ, a single bowl would never suffice. Observing this remarkable blessing, Aboo Taalib would often exclaim: **“Verily you are blessed!”**”"

						"date": "585 CE / 39 BH",
						"age": "~14-15 (some reports say ~20)",
						"year": 585,
						"eventId": 1,
						"details": "When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was approximately **14 or 15 years of age** (some accounts suggest he was around **20**), the significant conflict known as the **War of al-Fijaar** (The Sacrilegious War) erupted. This war pitted the Quraysh, along with their allies from the tribes of Kinaanah, against the tribe of Banoo Qays ‘Aylaan. This event holds considerable importance in Arab history and is documented amongst the notable \"Days of the Arabs\" (Ayyaam al-Arab).\r\n\r\nThe catalyst for this conflict involved an incident where **‘Urwaah al-Rahhaal ibn ‘Utbah ibn Rabee’a** leased a specialized container to **al-Nu’maan ibn al-Mundhir** for his trade in musk and similar goods. Subsequently, **al-Baraad ibn Qays**, a member of the Banoo Damrah tribe (part of Kinaanah), challenged ‘Urwaah’s dealings with those outside their tribal alliance, questioning his audacity to conduct business with anyone other than the sons of Kinaanah. ‘Urwaah retorted defiantly, asserting his right to trade with whomever he pleased.\r\n\r\nFollowing this exchange, ‘Urwaah ibn al-Rahhaal departed the marketplace, as did al-Baraad, who lay in wait for an opportune moment. When ‘Urwaah reached the elevated area of Tayman Dhee Zhilaal and became momentarily distracted, al-Baraad ambushed and killed him. This act, committed during one of the sacred months, led to the conflict being known as \"The Sacrilegious War\" due to the violation of the sanctity of these months.\r\n\r\nNews of ‘Urwaah’s killing reached the Quraysh, stating that al-Barraad had committed the deed in the marketplace of ‘Ukaazh during a sacred month. Upon hearing this, the Quraysh mobilized before the Banoo Hawwaazin tribe was fully aware. Once the news reached the Banoo Hawwaazin, they pursued the Quraysh and their allies, catching up with them before they could reach the sanctuary of the Haram. A fierce battle ensued, lasting until nightfall. However, upon entering the Haram, the fighting ceased as the Banoo Hawaazin respected its sanctity. In the days that followed, the tribes met in various engagements, each fighting alongside their respective allies. Every tribe from Quraysh and Kinaanah had a leader, as did the tribe of Banoo Qays.\r\n\r\nThe Messenger of Allah ﷺ himself witnessed some of the events of this war, particularly the **Day of the Palm Tree (Yawm al-Nakhlah)**. At this time, his age was reported to be **14 years**, although some accounts place it closer to **20**.\r\n\r\nAfter the cessation of hostilities and the departure of the tribes, during the month of Dhu’l-Qi’dah, the significant **Oath of the Righteous (Hilf al-Fudool)** took place. In this oath, the Quraysh pledged to always stand in support of the oppressed. This oath was prompted by an incident involving a man from Zabeed in Yemen who sold goods to a man from al-‘Aas ibn Waa’il al-Sahmee. Despite repeated requests for payment, the Yemeni man was consistently told he would be paid later. Eventually, Aboo Qubays stood on elevated ground and loudly proclaimed the injustice he had suffered. Moved by this, the Quraysh swore their oath to uphold justice, and the Prophet ﷺ was present at the swearing of this important oath."

						"eventId": 1,
						"details": "The Oath of the Righteous took place in one of the four sacred months of the Arab calendar. The various tribes of Quraysh were united around it: Banoo Haashim, Banoo Al-Muttalib, Asad ibn ‘Abd’ul-‘Uzzah ibn Kilaab, and Taym ibn Murrah. They gathered at the house of ‘Abdullah ibn Jud’aan al-Taymee because of his maturity and nobility. And so, they all swore and agreed that there would not be a single person ever oppressed in all of Makkah except that they would stand with them; and that they would fight against the oppressor until they returned what they had wrongfully taken.\r\n\r\nThe Messenger of Allah ﷺ was present at this oath and he said regarding it: **“Verily I have witnessed in the house of Abdullah ibn Jud’aan, an oath that is more beloved to me than red she-camels. Were I to be called upon to fulfill that oath in Islam, I would not hesitate!”** The very spirit of this oath negates the fanaticism of the time of Jaahiliyyah in which was overtaken by the spirit of excessive zeal for one’s clan and tribe.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the cause of this oath that a man from Banoo Zubayd arrived in Makkah with his goods for sale. Al-‘Aas ibn Waa’il al-Sahmee then purchased them from him, however, he did not pay him for them. He then appealed for assistance from his allies from amongst the Banoo Abd’l-Daar, Banoo Makhzoom, Banoo Jumah, Banoo Sahm, and the Banoo ‘Adee, but none of them did much to help him.\r\n\r\nThe man from the Banoo Zubayd then climbed a mountain and began calling out to people, and exclaiming, reciting poetry that described his plight. Hearing this, al-Zubayr ibn al-Muttalib agreed with it and and then said this man has no one to protect him.” Everyone gathered and agreed to the oath that came to be known as the Oath of the Righteous (Hilf al-Fudool). Then they all stood and went to al-‘Aas ibn Waa’il and took from him the right of the man from Zubayd.\r\n\r\nThe reason it came to be known as the Oath of the Righteous is because three men from the tribe of Jurhu: al-Fadl ibn Fadaalah, Fadl ibn Wadaa’ah, and Fadl ibn al-Haarith had all previously agreed to this sort of oath before. When the oath that was being agreed upon by Quraysh began to resemble the oath of those three men from Jurhum, it took of the name of The Oath of al-Fudool."

Why doesn't he come with you?”** He replied: **“I told him to, but he claimed that he feels shy.”** She mentioned this to her sister Khadijah, who said: **“I have never seen a man more modest, more chaste, or more... than Muhammad ﷺ.”**\r\n\r\nThis incident impressed Khadijah's sister, so she sent a message to the Prophet ﷺ saying: **“Go to my father and propose marriage to him.”** The Prophet ﷺ replied: **“Your father is a wealthy man, and he might not agree.”** She said: **“Go and meet him and speak to him, and I will take care of the rest.”**\r\n\r\nThe Prophet ﷺ married Khadijah (may Allah be pleased with her) while she was a widow."

Indeed, I insulted his nephew in a vile manner.\"**\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Certainty of the Heart: From Indignation to Faith\r\n\r\nIbn Ishaq reported:\r\n> \"Then Hamza returned home, and Satan came to him and said: You are the chief of Quraysh, yet you have followed this Sabi' (renegade), and abandoned the religion of your forefathers. Death is better for you than what you have done. Hamza then reflected and said to himself: **\"What have I done?! O Allah, if it is guidance, then make its affirmation firm in my heart, and if not, then grant me a way out from what I have fallen into.\"**\"\r\n\r\nHe spent a night unlike any other due to Satan's whisperings. When morning came, he went to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and said:\r\n> \"O son of my brother, I have fallen into a matter and I do not know how to get out of it. For someone like me to remain upon something I do not know whether it is guidance or severe error, is unacceptable. So, tell me a narrative; for I long, O son of my brother, for you to speak to me.\"\r\n\r\nThe Messenger of Allah ﷺ then **reminded him, advised him, warned him, and gave him glad tidings**, and Allah cast faith into his heart regarding what the Messenger of Allah ﷺ had said.\r\n\r\n> Hamza then declared: **\"I bear witness that you are the truthful one, with a truthful testimony. So, proclaim your religion, O son of my brother, for by Allah, I would not wish to have all that the sky covers, and yet remain upon my former religion.\"**\r\n\r\nThus, Hamza's Islam (may Allah be pleased with him) was initially out of **a man's indignation who refused to see his protected one humiliated**, but then Allah expanded his chest, and he held fast to the firmest handhold. **The Muslims found immense strength through him!**"

There is no deity except Me, so worship Me and establish prayer for My remembrance.﴾**\r\nHe said: **\"How beautiful and honorable is this speech? Guide me to Muhammad.\"**\r\n\r\nSo he went to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and **embraced Islam with him**.

When At-Tufail ibn Amr Ad-Dausi arrived in Mecca, he was a noble, eloquent poet. Men from Quraysh approached him.\r\n\r\n> They said to him: \"O Tufail, you have come to our land, and this man among us has caused us **great trouble – his matter has become severe** – and he has divided our community and scattered our affairs. His speech is like magic; it separates a man from his father, a man from his brother, and a man from his wife. We fear for you and your people what has afflicted us, so **do not speak to him or listen to anything from him**.\"\r\n\r\nAt-Tufail narrated:\r\n> \"By Allah, they did not cease to urge me until I resolved not to listen to anything from him or speak to him. So much so that **I stuffed my ears with cotton when I went to the Mosque, for fear that any of his words might reach me, and I did not want to hear him**.\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## A Predestined Listening and the Light of Truth\r\n\r\nDespite his precautions, Allah willed that At-Tufail listen to the Prophet ﷺ.\r\n> \"So I went to the Mosque, and behold, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was standing, praying near the Kaaba. He said: I stood near him, and **Allah willed nothing but that I hear some of his words**. He said: I heard beautiful speech.\"\r\n\r\nAt this point, he began to reproach himself, being a discerning and insightful man:\r\n> \"I said to myself: Woe to my mother! By Allah, I am an intelligent poet; good and bad are not hidden from me. **What prevents me from listening to what this man says? If what he brings is good, I will accept it, and if it is bad, I will leave it**.\"\r\n\r\nAt-Tufail remained until the Messenger of Allah ﷺ departed for his home, and he followed him.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## The Presentation of Islam and the Miracle of Light\r\n\r\nWhen the Messenger of Allah ﷺ entered his house, At-Tufail entered upon him and said:\r\n> \"O Muhammad, your people said such and such to me, for what they said; by Allah, they did not stop trying to frighten me about your matter until **I plugged my ears with cotton so that I would not hear your words**. Then **Allah willed nothing but that I hear your words, and I heard beautiful speech, so present your matter to me**.\"\r\n\r\nAt-Tufail said:\r\n> \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ presented Islam to me and recited the Quran to me, and **by Allah, I have never heard speech more beautiful than it, nor a matter more just than it**. So I embraced Islam and bore witness to the truth.\"\r\n\r\nAfter accepting Islam, At-Tufail asked for a sign to aid him in inviting his people:\r\n> He said: \"O Prophet of Allah, I am a man obeyed among my people, and I am returning to them, inviting them to Islam. **So pray to Allah to grant me a sign that will be an aid to me against them in what I invite them to**.\"\r\n> The Prophet ﷺ said: **\"O Allah, grant him a sign.\"**\r\n\r\nAt-Tufail then set out for his people.\r\n> He said: \"When I reached a mountain pass – **the gap between two mountains** – that overlooked the encampment – **meaning, the people residing by the water** – **a light appeared between my eyes like a lamp**. I said: O Allah, not on my face, for I fear they will think it is a disfigurement that has befallen my face for abandoning their religion. He said: **So it shifted and settled on the tip of my whip**.\"\r\n\r\nThis light became a clear sign for his people:\r\n> He said: \"The people present began to see that light on my whip like a hanging lamp, as I descended to them from the mountain pass. He said: until I reached them and was among them by morning.\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## The Islam of His Father and Wife, and the Invitation to His Tribe\r\n\r\nUpon his arrival, his father and wife were the first to embrace Islam through him:\r\n> When I arrived, my father came to me; he was an old man. I said: \"Keep away from me, O my father, for I am not from you, and you are not from me.\"\r\n> He asked: \"Why, my son?\"\r\n> I replied: **\"I have embraced Islam and followed the religion of Muhammad ﷺ.\"**\r\n> He said: \"My son, then **my religion is your religion**.\"\r\n> I said: \"Then go and wash yourself and purify your clothes, then come so I may teach you what I have learned.\"\r\n> He went and washed himself, purified his clothes, then came, and I presented Islam to him, and **he embraced Islam**.\r\n\r\nThen his wife came:\r\n> \"Then my companion – **my wife** – came to me, and I said: Keep away from me, for I am not from you, and you are not from me. She asked: Why, by my father and mother? I replied: Islam has separated between me and you, and I have followed the religion of Muhammad ﷺ. She said: **Then my religion is your religion**. I said: Then go and purify yourself. So she went and performed ghusl, then came, and I presented Islam to her, and **she embraced Islam**.\"\r\n\r\nThen he invited his tribe, Daus, to Islam, but they were slow to respond.\r\n> He said: \"Then I came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ in Mecca, and I said to him: O Prophet of Allah, indeed **adultery – amusement with preoccupation of heart and sight** – has overcome Daus, so pray to Allah against them.\"\r\n> He said: **\"O Allah, guide Daus. Return to your people, invite them, and be gentle with them.\"**\r\n\r\nAt-Tufail continued to invite them:\r\n> He said: \"I continued to invite them to Islam in the land of Daus until the Messenger of Allah ﷺ migrated to Medina, and Badr, Uhud, and Al-Khandaq passed. Then I came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ with those of my people who had embraced Islam with me, while the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was at Khaybar. I arrived in Medina with seventy or eighty households from Daus, then we joined the Messenger of Allah ﷺ at Khaybar, and he allotted shares to us along with the Muslims.\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## His Martyrdom in the Path of Allah\r\n\r\nAt-Tufail (may Allah be pleased with him) remained with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ until Allah granted him the conquest of Mecca. He was with him in Medina until Allah took the soul of His Messenger ﷺ. When the Arabs apostatized, he went out with the Muslims, marching with them until they completed the matter of **Tulaiha** and all the land of **Najd**. Then he marched with the Muslims to **Al-Yamamah**, and **was martyred there**."

Some members of Quraysh were pleased with this covenant, while others disliked it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Efforts to Annul the Document\r\n\r\nThose who disliked the document strived to annul it. The leader of this effort was **Hisham ibn Amr from Banu Amir ibn Lu'ayy**. He used to secretly provide food to Banu Hashim in the valley at night.\r\n\r\nHisham went to **Zuhair ibn Abi Umayyah al-Makhzumi** (whose mother was Atikah bint Abd al-Muttalib) and said to him:\r\n> \"O Zuhair, are you content to eat food and drink beverages while your maternal uncles are in the state you know?\"\r\n>\r\n> Zuhair replied: \"Woe to you, what can I do as I am only one man? By Allah, if I had another man with me, I would rise to annul it.\"\r\n>\r\n> Hisham said: \"You have found a man.\"\r\n>\r\n> Zuhair asked: \"Who is he?\"\r\n>\r\n> Hisham said: \"I am.\"\r\n\r\nZuhair then said to him: **\"Find us a third man.\"**\r\n\r\nSo Hisham went to **Al-Mut'im ibn Adi**, reminding him of the kinship with Banu Hashim and Banu al-Muttalib (the two sons of Abd Manaf), and rebuked him for his agreement with Quraysh on this injustice.\r\n> Al-Mut'im said: \"Woe to you, what can I do? I am only one man.\"\r\n>\r\n> Hisham said: \"You have found a second.\"\r\n>\r\n> He asked: \"Who is he?\"\r\n>\r\n> Hisham said: \"I am.\"\r\n>\r\n> He said: \"Find us a third.\"\r\n>\r\n> Hisham said: \"I have already done so.\"\r\n>\r\n> He asked: \"Who is he?\"\r\n>\r\n> Hisham said: \"Zuhair ibn Abi Umayyah.\"\r\n>\r\n> He said: \"Find us a fourth.\"\r\n\r\nThen Hisham went to **Abu al-Bakhtari ibn Hisham**, and said to him something similar to what he had said to Al-Mut'im.\r\n> He asked: \"Is there anyone who will help with this?\"\r\n>\r\n> Hisham said: \"Yes.\"\r\n>\r\n> He asked: \"Who is he?\"\r\n>\r\n> Hisham said: \"Zuhair ibn Abi Umayyah, and Al-Mut'im ibn Adi, and I am with you.\"\r\n>\r\n> He said: \"Find us a fifth.\"\r\n\r\nSo Hisham went to **Zam'ah ibn al-Aswad ibn al-Muttalib ibn Asad**, spoke to him, and reminded him of their kinship and rights.\r\n> He asked him: \"Is there anyone else with you on this matter you are inviting me to?\"\r\n>\r\n> Hisham said: \"Yes.\" Then he named the others.\r\n\r\nThey gathered at Al-Hajun and made a pact to proceed with annulling the document. Zuhair said: **\"I will begin for you and be the first to speak.\"**\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Confrontation in the Mosque and Annulment of the Document\r\n\r\nWhen morning came, they went to their assemblies. Zuhair, wearing a fine garment, circumambulated the Kaaba seven times, then turned to the people and said:\r\n> **\"O people of Mecca, shall we eat food and wear clothes while Banu Hashim are perishing, with nothing sold to them or bought from them? By Allah, I will not sit down until this oppressive, cutting document is torn up.\"**\r\n\r\nAbu Jahl, who was in a corner of the Mosque, said: **\"You lie, by Allah, it will not be torn up.\"**\r\nZam'ah ibn al-Aswad said: **\"You are the greater liar, by Allah, we did not approve of its writing when it was written.\"**\r\nAbu al-Bakhtari said: **\"Zam'ah spoke the truth, we do not approve of what was written in it, nor do we affirm it.\"**\r\nAl-Mut'im ibn Adi said: **\"You both spoke the truth, and whoever said otherwise lied. We disavow it and what was written in it before Allah.\"**\r\nHisham ibn Amr said something similar.\r\nAbu Jahl then said: **\"This is a matter decided by night, and conspired upon in another place.\"**\r\n\r\nAbu Talib was sitting in a corner of the Mosque. He had come to them because Allah had informed His Messenger ﷺ about the matter of the document, and that **termites (al-arad) had eaten all of its injustice, severance, and oppression, except for the mention of Allah Almighty.** He then informed his uncle of this, who went to Quraysh and told them that his nephew had said such and such.\r\n> \"If he is a liar, we will leave him to you, but if he is truthful, you must cease your boycott and oppression of us.\"\r\n>\r\n> They said: \"You have been fair.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the discussion between the people and Abu Jahl, Al-Mut'im went to the document to tear it. He **found that the termites had eaten it all except for \"(In Your Name, O Allah)\"**, and whatever contained the name of Allah was not eaten.\r\n\r\nThen he annulled the document, and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and those with him came out of the valley. The polytheists had seen a great sign from the signs of his prophethood, but as Allah informed about them: **﴿And if they see a sign, they turn away and say, \"Continuous magic.\"﴾** They turned away from this sign and increased in their disbelief."

If Allah unites them upon you, then there will be no man more honored than you.\"**\r\n\r\nThen they departed, returning to their land, having believed and affirmed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## The Spread of Islam in Medina\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived in Medina among their people, they mentioned the Messenger of Allah ﷺ to them and invited them to Islam, until **it spread among them, and there was no house among the Ansar's houses except that it contained mention of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ**."

His migration to it was after the first pledge of Al-Aqabah and before the second pledge of Al-Aqabah, when the Quraish harmed him after his return from Abyssinia. So he resolved to return to it, then he heard that they had brothers in Medina, so he resolved to migrate to it.\r\n\r\nUmm Salama said: When Abu Salama decided to go out to Medina, he saddled his camel for me, then mounted me on it, and put my son Salama ibn Abi Salama in my lap. Then he went out leading my camel, and the Banu Abd al-Asad set out with him, and the Banu al-Mughira detained me with them, and my husband Abu Salama went to Medina. She said: So I was separated from my son and my husband. She said: I used to go out every morning and sit in Al-Abtah, and I would continue to weep until evening, for a year or close to it, until a man from my cousins, one of the Banu al-Mughira, passed by me and saw my condition and had mercy on me. He said to the Banu al-Mughira:\r\n>“Do you not feel ashamed of this poor woman? You have separated her from her husband and her child!”\r\n\r\nShe said:\r\n>“So they said to me: Join your husband if you wish.”\r\n\r\nShe said:\r\n>“So the Banu Abd al-Asad returned my son to me at that time. So I mounted my camel, then I took my son and put him in my lap, then I went out intending to join my husband in Medina. And no one from Allah's creation was with me, until I was in Al-Tan'im, and Uthman ibn Talha ibn Abi Talha, the brother of the Banu Abd al-Dar, met me. He said: ‘Where are you going, O daughter of Abi Umayya?’ I said: ‘I want to join my husband in Medina.’ He said: ‘Is no one with you?’ I said: ‘No one is with me except Allah and this son of mine.’ He said: ‘By Allah, you should not be left alone.’ So he took the reins of the camel and set off with me, hastening my pace. By Allah, I have never accompanied any man of the Arabs whom I thought was more noble than him. When he reached a resting place, he would make me dismount, then he would move away from me until I had dismounted, then he would move his camel away and unload it, then tie it to a tree, then he would go to a tree and lie down under it. When it was time to travel, he would go to my camel and bring it forward and saddle it, then he would move away from me and say: ‘Mount.’ When I had mounted and settled on my camel, he would come and take its reins and lead me until we reached the next resting place. He continued to do that for me until he brought me to Medina. When he saw the village of Banu Amr ibn Awf in Quba, he said: ‘Your husband is in this village.’ And Abu Salama was staying there, so enter it with the blessing of Allah. Then he turned back to Mecca.”\r\n\r\nUmm Salama used to say:\r\n>“I do not know of any household in Islam who suffered as much as the family of Abu Salama, and I have never seen a companion who was more noble than Uthman ibn Talha.”\r\n\r\nUthman ibn Talha ibn Abi Talha al-Abdari embraced Islam after Al-Hudaybiyya."

Concern and worry filled them, so the tyrants of Mecca gathered in Dar al-Nadwah (the House of Assembly) to make a decisive decision regarding this matter. Their meeting was approximately two and a half months after the Pledge of Aqabah. All the representatives of the Quraishi tribes converged for this meeting to discuss a decisive plan that would swiftly ensure the elimination of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his message.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at Dar al-Nadwah as agreed, Iblis (Satan) appeared to them in the guise of a venerable old man and stood at the door. They asked: \"Who is this old man?\" He said: \"An old man from the people of Najd. I heard what you have gathered for and came to be with you to hear what you say. Perhaps I can offer you an opinion and advice.\" They said: \"Yes, come in.\" So, he entered with them.\r\n\r\nAfter the meeting was complete and the discussion had gone on for a long time:\r\n\r\nAbu al-Aswad said:\r\n> \"Let us expel him from among us and banish him from our land. We will not care where he goes or where he lands. We will have set our affairs right, and our unity will be restored as it was.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man from Najd (Iblis) said:\r\n> \"No, by Allah, this is not a good opinion for you. Have you not seen the beauty of his speech, the sweetness of his words, and his mastery over the hearts of men with what he brings? By Allah, if you were to do that, you would not be safe from him settling among another Arab tribe, and then he would lead them against you – after they follow him – until he would tread upon you in your own land, and then he would do with you as he wished. Devise an opinion other than this.\"\r\n\r\nAbu al-Bakhtari said:\r\n> \"Imprison him in chains and lock a door upon him, then wait for him to meet the same fate as the poets before him – like Zuhayr and al-Nabigha – and those who passed away from this death, until he meets what they met.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man from Najd said:\r\n> \"No, by Allah, this is not a good opinion for you. By Allah, if you imprison him as you say, his matter will certainly escape from behind the door you locked him behind to his companions, and they will soon rise up against you, snatch him from your hands, and then overwhelm you with him until they conquer you in your affair. This is not a good opinion for you; look for something else.\"\r\n\r\nAfter that, the chief criminal of Mecca, Abu Jahl ibn Hisham, presented a sinful proposal that all those present agreed upon. Abu Jahl said:\r\n> \"By Allah, I have an opinion about him that I don't think you have come across yet.\"\r\n\r\nThey asked: \"What is it, O Abul Hakam?\" He said:\r\n> \"I suggest that we take a vigorous, strong, noble, and influential young man from every tribe among us, and then we give each young man a sharp sword. Then they should all aim for him and strike him with it as one man and kill him, and we will be rid of him. For if they do that, his blood will be distributed among all the tribes, and Banu Abd Manaf will not be able to wage war against all their people. So, they will accept blood money from us, and we will pay it to them.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man from Najd said:\r\n> \"The saying is what this man said. This is the only opinion; there is no other.\"\r\n\r\nAnd they unanimously agreed upon this sinful proposal."

So, whoever wished to migrate did so towards Medina, and the majority of those who had migrated to Abyssinia returned to Medina. Abu Bakr also prepared to migrate towards Medina. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him:\r\n>\r\n> <span className=\"font-quran\" dir=\"rtl\">«عَلَى رِسْلِكَ، فَإِنِّي أَرْجُو أَنْ يُؤْذَنَ لِي»</span>\r\n>\r\n> 'Take your time, for I hope that I will be given permission (to migrate).'\r\n>\r\n> Abu Bakr asked: 'Do you hope for that, may my father be sacrificed for you?' He said:\r\n>\r\n> <span className=\"font-quran\" dir=\"rtl\">«نَعَمْ»</span>\r\n>\r\n> 'Yes.'\r\n>\r\n> So, Abu Bakr restrained himself for the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in order to accompany him, and he fed two riding camels he had with Samur leaves – which is called Al-Khabat – for four months.\"\r\n\r\nIbn Shihab said: Urwah said: Aisha narrated:\r\n\r\n> \"While we were one day sitting in Abu Bakr's house at noon, someone said to Abu Bakr: 'This is the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), covered, coming at an hour he usually did not visit us.' Abu Bakr said: 'May my father and mother be sacrificed for him! By Allah, nothing but an important matter has brought him at this hour.' Aisha said: 'So the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came and asked for permission, and he was admitted. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Abu Bakr:\r\n>\r\n> <span className=\"font-quran\" dir=\"rtl\">«أَخْرِجْ مَن عِنْدَكَ»</span>\r\n>\r\n> 'Ask those who are with you to leave.'\r\n>\r\n> Abu Bakr said: 'They are only your family, may my father be sacrificed for you, O Messenger of Allah.'

The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:\r\n>\r\n> <span className=\"font-quran\" dir=\"rtl\">«بِالثَّمَنِ»</span>\r\n>\r\n> 'For its price.'\r\n>\r\n> Aisha said: 'So we prepared them with the utmost readiness, and we made a provisions bag for them. Asma bint Abi Bakr cut a piece from her waist belt and tied the mouth of the bag with it, and for this, she was named 'Dhat al-Nitaqayn' (The One of the Two Belts).' Aisha continued: 'Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and Abu Bakr caught up with a cave in Mount Thawr, and they hid in it for three nights. Abdullah ibn Abi Bakr, a young, intelligent, and perceptive man, would spend the night with them. He would leave them at dawn and spend the morning with Quraish in Mecca as if he had spent the night there. He would not hear of any plot against them except that he would remember it, until he would bring them the news when darkness fell. Amir ibn Fuhayrah, Abu Bakr's freed slave, would graze a flock of sheep for them, and he would bring them back when an hour of the evening had passed. They would spend the night sustained by the milk and fresh butter from his flock, until Amir ibn Fuhayrah would drive them away at dawn. He would do this every night for those three nights. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and Abu Bakr hired a man from Banu al-Dīl, from Banu Abd ibn Adi, a skilled guide – Al-Khirrit is one who is expert in guiding – who had a sworn alliance with the family of Al-As ibn Wa'il as-Sahmi. He was on the religion of the polytheists of Quraish. They trusted him and handed over their two riding camels to him, and they agreed to meet him at the cave of Thawr after three nights, with their two camels on the morning of the third day. Amir ibn Fuhayrah and the guide went with them, and he took them by the coastal route.\"\r\n\r\nSuraqah ibn Ju'shum narrated:\r\n\r\n> \"The messengers of the Quraish disbelievers came to us, offering the blood money of each of them for the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and Abu Bakr, to whoever killed or captured him. While I was sitting in a gathering of my people, Banu Mudlij, a man from them approached until he stood over us while we were sitting, and he said: 'O Suraqah, I just saw some black figures on the coast, I think they are Muhammad and his companions.' Suraqah said: 'I knew it was them, but I said to him: 'They are not them, but you saw so-and-so, they went off before our very eyes.' Then I waited in the gathering for an hour, then I got up and went inside and ordered my slave-girl to take my horse out for me from behind a hill and keep it ready for me. I took my spear and went out with it from the back of the house, dragging its tip on the ground and lowering its upper part, until I reached my horse and mounted it. I made it gallop fast until I got close to them. Then my horse stumbled with me, and I fell from it. I got up and put my hand to my quiver, took out the arrows for divination, and sought an omen: 'Shall I harm them or not?' The result was what I disliked. I mounted my horse and disobeyed the omen, making it gallop fast. When I heard the recitation of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), he did not turn around, but Abu Bakr kept looking back. My horse's forelegs sank into the ground up to its knees, and I fell from it. Then I scolded it, and it stood up, barely managing to pull out its forelegs. When it stood straight, there was a rising cloud of dust from its forelegs like smoke in the sky. I sought an omen again with the arrows, and the result was what I disliked. So I called out to them for safety, and they stopped. I mounted my horse until I reached them. It occurred to me when I encountered what I encountered in being stopped from reaching them that the matter of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would prevail. So I said to him: 'Your people have set a blood money for you,' and I informed them of the news of what people intended against them, and I offered them provisions and supplies. They did not take anything from me nor did they ask, except that he (the Prophet) said:\r\n>\r\n> <span className=\"font-quran\" dir=\"rtl\">«أَخْفِ عَنَّا»</span>\r\n>\r\n> 'Keep our matter secret.'\r\n>\r\n> I asked him to write a letter of security for me. He ordered Amir ibn Fuhayrah to write it on a piece of leather. Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) proceeded.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Urwah ibn al-Zubayr:\r\n\r\n> \"The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) met Al-Zubayr in a caravan of Muslims who were merchants returning from Syria. Al-Zubayr clothed the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and Abu Bakr in white garments. The Muslims in Medina heard of the Messenger of Allah's (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) departure from Mecca, so they would go out every morning to Al-Harrah (the stony plain) and wait for him until the heat of noon would force them back. One day, after a long wait, they returned to their homes. When they had settled in, a man from the Jews ascended one of their forts to look at something. He caught sight of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his companions, appearing bright white, moving through the shimmering mirage. The Jew could not help but shout at the top of his voice:\r\n>\r\n> <span className=\"font-quran\" dir=\"rtl\">يَا مَعَاشِرَ الْعَرَبِ، هَذَا جَدُّكُمُ الَّذِي تَنتَظِرُونَ</span>\r\n>\r\n> 'O assembly of Arabs, this is your grandfather (i.e., your desired one) whom you were waiting for!'\r\n>\r\n> The Muslims rushed to their weapons and met the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) at the outskirts of Al-Harrah. He then turned with them to the right, until he dismounted with them among Banu Amr ibn Awf. This was on a Monday in the month of Rabi' al-Awwal. Abu Bakr stood for the people, while the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) remained silent. Those Ansar who had not seen the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) began to greet Abu Bakr, until the sun struck the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Abu Bakr then came and shaded him with his cloak. It was then that the people recognized the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\""

To this, **Baheera** asked: **“What then happened to his father?”** Aboo Taalib explained: **“He passed away while his mother was still pregnant with him.”**\r\n\r\n**Baheera** affirmed: **“That is correct…return with him to his land and safeguard him from the Jews.

We have neither resources nor trade. Now, your people's caravan is preparing to depart for Syria, and Khadijah bint Khuwaylid sends men from your tribe with her caravans, and they trade with her wealth and gain profits. If you were to approach her and offer your services, she would readily accept you and prefer you over others because of what has reached her about your purity. Though I dislike for you to go to Syria and fear the Jews for you, we have no other choice.”\r\n\r\nKhadijah bint Khuwaylid was a noble and wealthy businesswoman with extensive trade that she would send to Syria. Her caravan was like any other large caravan of the Quraysh. She used to hire men and give them her wealth on a profit-sharing basis. News of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ's truthfulness, great trustworthiness, and noble character reached Khadijah, so she sent him to trade on her behalf.\r\n\r\nHe ﷺ set out with her servant Maysarah until they reached Syria. His uncles had instructed the people of the caravan to take good care of him. When they arrived in Busra, they rested in the shade of a tree near a monk's hermitage called Nastura. The monk looked at Maysarah—whom he knew—and said: **“O Maysarah, who is this who has rested under this tree?”** Maysarah replied: **“A man from the Quraysh, from the people of the sanctuary.”** The monk said to him: **“None has ever rested under this tree except a Prophet.”**\r\n\r\nThen, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sold his goods—his merchandise that he had taken—and bought what he intended to buy. Then he returned with the caravan to Makkah, accompanied by Maysarah. When he presented Khadijah with her wealth in Makkah, she sold what he had brought for double or close to double the profit. Maysarah narrated to her what the monk had said and what he had witnessed of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ's affairs.\r\n\r\nThereupon, Khadijah (may Allah be pleased with her) proposed marriage to him. She was the most distinguished woman of the Quraysh in lineage, the greatest in honor, and the wealthiest. When she conveyed this to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, he mentioned it to his uncles. His uncle Hamzah went with him until they entered upon Khuwaylid ibn Asad and proposed marriage to her on his behalf. The Prophet ﷺ then married her, and she was the first woman he married. He did not marry another woman until she passed away (may Allah be pleased with her)."

In the Name of your Lord Who has created (all that exists), has created man from a clot (a piece of thick coagulated blood). Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous, Who has taught (the writing) by the pen, has taught man that which he knew not.\"* (Al-Alaq 96:1-5)\r\n\r\nHe ﷺ recounted this to his wife Khadijah, who then narrated what had happened to Waraqah ibn Nawfal, and he confirmed it, saying: **“This is the same Angel who came to Musa.”** Then the revelation ceased for a period of time. After that, Jibreel came to him again while he was sitting on a chair, so the Prophet ﷺ was afraid of him and returned to his family saying: **“Cover me! Cover me!”** Then Allah تعالى revealed:\r\n\r\n> يَاأَيُّهَا الْمُدَّثِّرُ (1) قُمْ فَأَنْذِرْ (2) وَرَبَّكَ فَكَبِّرْ (3) وَثِيَابَكَ فَطَهِّرْ (4) وَالرُّجْزَ فَاهْجُرْ (5)\r\n>\r\n> *\"O you (Muhammad ﷺ) enveloped in garments! Arise and warn! And your Lord (Allâh) magnify! And your garments purify! And keep away from Ar-Rujz (the idols)!\"* (Al-Muddaththir 74:1-5)\r\n\r\nThis was the beginning of his prophethood and the commencement of the command to convey the message."

						"details": "## Return and Second Migration\r\n\r\nThe migrants in Abyssinia heard that **Quraysh had embraced Islam**, so they returned to Mecca in **Shawwal of the same year they had migrated**.\r\n\r\n> However, when they were a short distance from Mecca and realized the true situation, some of them returned to Abyssinia, and none of the others entered Mecca except secretly or under the protection of a Quraysh man.\r\n\r\nThen, the affliction and torment from Quraysh intensified upon them and upon the Muslims, and their tribes oppressed them severely. It was difficult for Quraysh to bear the news of the Negus's good treatment. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) saw no alternative but to advise his companions to migrate to Abyssinia **a second time**.\r\n\r\nThe Muslims prepared for the migration again. Quraysh attempted to thwart the second migration, but the Muslims were swifter, reaching the Negus of Abyssinia before they could be overtaken.\r\n\r\n**Eighty-three men and eighteen or nineteen women** migrated.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Quraysh's Delegation to the Negus\r\n\r\nQuraysh sent **Amr ibn al-Aas and Abdullah ibn Abi Rabee'ah** before they embraced Islam, and they sent with them **rare gifts** for the Negus and his patriarchs. After they arrived before the Negus, they presented him with the gifts, then spoke to him, saying:\r\n> **\"O King, indeed some foolish youths have sought refuge in your land. They have abandoned the religion of their people and have not entered your religion. They have come with a religion they invented, which neither we nor you know. The nobles of their people, their fathers, uncles, and tribes, have sent us to you concerning them, so that you may return them to them, for they know them better and are more aware of what they have criticized them for.\"**\r\n\r\nThey admonished them in his presence, and the patriarchs said: **\"They have spoken truly, O King, so hand them over to them, that they may return them to their people and their lands.\"**\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## The Negus's Dialogue with the Muslims\r\n\r\nThe Negus then sent for the Muslims and invited them. They came, having resolved to **speak nothing but the truth, whatever the consequences.**\r\n\r\nThe Negus asked them:\r\n> **\"What is this religion in which you have separated from your people, and which you have not entered my religion or any of these religions?\"**\r\n\r\n**Ja'far ibn Abi Talib** (who was the spokesman for the Muslims) replied:\r\n> \"O King, we were a people of ignorance; we used to worship idols, eat carrion, commit indecencies, break ties of kinship, treat our neighbors badly, and the strong among us would devour the weak.\"\r\n>\r\n> He then enumerated the good things that the Prophet (peace be upon him) brought them, and continued: \"So we believed him, and had faith in him, and followed him in what he brought us from the religion of Allah. We worshipped Allah alone, associating nothing with Him, and we forbade what was forbidden to us, and permitted what was permitted to us. Then our people rose against us, torturing us and trying to turn us away from our religion, to make us return to the worship of idols instead of worshipping Allah Almighty, and to permit the abominations we used to permit. When they oppressed us, wronged us, made life difficult for us, and came between us and our religion, we came out to your land, choosing you over anyone else, desiring your protection, and hoping that we would not be wronged in your presence, O King.\"\r\n\r\nThe Negus asked him: **\"Do you have anything with you from what he (Muhammad) brought from Allah?\"**\r\nJa'far replied: **\"Yes.\"**\r\n\r\nThe Negus said: **\"Then recite it to me.\"**\r\nSo he recited to him the beginning of **(Surah Maryam)**.\r\n> The Negus wept until his beard was wet, and his bishops wept until their scriptures were wet when they heard what was recited to them.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## The Negus's Decision and Support for the Muslims\r\n\r\nThen the Negus said to them:\r\n> **\"Indeed, this and what Jesus brought come from the same source. Go, for by Allah, I will not hand them over to you both, nor shall they be harmed\"** (addressing Amr ibn al-Aas and his companion).\r\n\r\nSo they departed. When they left, Amr ibn al-Aas said to Abdullah ibn Abi Rabee'ah:\r\n> **\"By Allah, tomorrow I will come to him with something about them that will utterly destroy their flourishing.\"**\r\n\r\nAbdullah ibn Abi Rabee'ah said to him: **\"Do not do it, for they have kinship, even if they have differed with us.\"**\r\nBut Amr persisted in his opinion.\r\n\r\nThe next day, he said to the Negus: **\"O King, they say a great thing about Jesus, son of Mary.\"**\r\n\r\nSo the Negus sent for them, asking them about their statement concerning the Messiah. They were alarmed, but resolved to speak nothing but the truth, whatever the consequences. When they entered before him and he asked them, Ja'far said to him:\r\n> **\"We say concerning him what our Prophet (peace be upon him) brought us: He is the servant of Allah and His Messenger, and His spirit and His word which He cast to Mary the Virgin and the pure.\"**\r\n\r\nThe Negus took a stick from the ground and then said:\r\n> **\"By Allah, Jesus, son of Mary, did not exceed what you said by this stick.\"**\r\n\r\nHis patriarchs grumbled, so he said: **\"Even if you grumble!\"**\r\nThen he said to the Muslims:\r\n> **\"Go, for you are safe in my land – and 'Shuyoom' means 'safe ones' in the Abyssinian language – whoever insults you will be fined, whoever insults you will be fined, whoever insults you will be fined. I would not wish to have a mountain of gold, and yet harm one of you – and 'dabr' means 'mountain' in the Abyssinian language –.\"**\r\n\r\nThen he said to his entourage:\r\n> **\"Return their gifts to them, for I have no need of them. By Allah, Allah did not take a bribe from me when He restored my kingdom to me, so I shall not take a bribe concerning it. And the people did not obey me in my matters, so I shall not obey them in this.\"**\r\n\r\nUmm Salamah said:\r\n> **\"So they left his presence disgraced, with what they had brought returned to them, and we remained with him in the best of homes with the best of neighbors.\"**"

We gathered with him, one or two men at a time, until we were all present, and we said: **‘O Messenger of Allah, we pledge allegiance to you.’** He said: **‘You pledge allegiance to me to listen and obey in times of enthusiasm and disinclination, and to spend in times of hardship and ease, and to enjoin good and forbid evil, and to speak for the sake of Allah, fearing no blame from anyone for the sake of Allah, and to support me and protect me if I come to you from that which you protect your own selves, your wives, and your children, and for you will be Paradise.’** He said: So we stood up to him and pledged allegiance to him. And As'ad ibn Zurarah, who was the youngest of them, took his hand and said: **‘Wait, O people of Yathrib! We have not struck the livers of camels except that we know that he is the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and that expelling him today means the alienation of all the Arabs, and the killing of your best men, and that the swords will bite you. So either you are a people who can endure that, and your reward will be with Allah, or you are a people who fear for yourselves a calamity, so make that clear, for that will be an excuse for you before Allah.’** They said: **‘Leave us alone, O As'ad! By Allah, we will never forsake this pledge, and we will never withdraw from it.’** He said: So we stood up to him and pledged allegiance to him, and he took our pledge and stipulated conditions for us, and for that he promised us Paradise.”"

So, they began to leave in groups.\r\n\r\nAmong the first to migrate after the Second Pledge of Aqabah was Mus'ab ibn Umayr. Then came Amir ibn Rabi'ah, an ally of Banu Adi ibn Ka'b, along with his wife Layla bint Abi Hathmah ibn Ghanim. Following them was Abdullah ibn Jahsh with his family and his brother Abd ibn Jahsh (also known as Abu Ahmad), who was blind. Their residences, along with that of Abu Salamah, were in Quba, among Banu Amr ibn Awf.\r\n\r\nWhen all of Banu Jahsh migrated with their women, Abu Sufyan seized their empty house in Mecca. When news of this reached Abdullah ibn Jahsh, he mentioned it to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him:\r\n\r\n> \"Are you not pleased, O Abdullah, that Allah will give you a house in Paradise better than it?\"\r\n\r\nAbdullah replied: \"Yes!\" The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"Then that is for you.\" Later, when the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) conquered Mecca, Abu Ahmad (Abdullah ibn Jahsh's brother) spoke to him about their house, but the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) hesitated to address it. The people then told Abu Ahmad: \"O Abu Ahmad, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) dislikes that you should seek to reclaim anything you sacrificed for the sake of Allah.\" So, he refrained from speaking to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about it.\r\n\r\nAll of Banu Ghanim ibn Dudan were Muslims and had all migrated to Medina.\r\n\r\nThen, Umar ibn al-Khattab and Ayyash ibn Abi Rabi'ah migrated with twenty riders and arrived in Medina. Hisham ibn al-As ibn Wa'il had also embraced Islam and promised Umar ibn al-Khattab that he would migrate with him. He said: \"You will find me, or I will find you, at Ada'ah of Banu Ghifar.\" However, Hisham's people became aware of his intention and detained him, preventing his migration.\r\n\r\nThen, Abu Jahl and Al-Harith ibn Hisham left Mecca and reached Medina while the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was still in Mecca. They spoke to Ayyash ibn Abi Rabi'ah, who was their maternal half-brother and cousin. They informed him that his mother had vowed not to wash her head or seek shade until she saw him. Ayyash felt pity for his mother and believed them, so he set out to return with them. On the way, they tied him up and brought him to Mecca in broad daylight, bound. Then they said: \"O people of Mecca, do this with your foolish ones just as we have done with our foolish one!\" They imprisoned him there until Allah rescued him later through the supplication of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) during the Qunut prayer:\r\n\r\n> <span className=\"font-quran\" dir=\"rtl\">اللَّهُمَّ أَنْجِ الْوَلِيدَ بْنَ الْوَلِيدِ، وَسَلَمَةَ بْنَ هِشَامٍ، وَعَيَّاشَ بْنَ أَبِي رَبِيعَةَ.</span>\r\n\r\n\"O Allah, save Al-Walid ibn Al-Walid, Salamah ibn Hisham, and Ayyash ibn Abi Rabi'ah.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Suhayb ibn Sinan intended to migrate, the disbelievers of Quraish said to him: \"You came to us as a poor, lowly person, and your wealth grew with us, and you reached the position you reached. Now you want to leave with your wealth and yourself? No, by Allah, that will not happen!\" Suhayb said to them: \"What if I give you all my wealth, will you clear my way?\" They said: \"Yes.\" So he said: \"Indeed, I have given it to you.\" When this news reached the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), he said:\r\n\r\n> \"Suhayb has profited! Suhayb has profited!\"\r\n\r\nThen the Muhajireen continued to migrate to Medina until the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) himself migrated."

When I heard the news of the Messenger of Allah's (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) arrival, I exclaimed 'Allahu Akbar' (Allah is the Greatest)!

I replied to her: 'O aunt, by Allah, he is the brother of Musa ibn Imran, and he is upon his religion, sent with what Musa was sent with.' She then asked: 'O son of my brother, is he the Prophet about whom we were told he would be sent just before the Hour?' I said to her: 'Yes.'

So, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) let me enter one of his houses. The Jews then came to him, spoke with him, and questioned him. Then he asked them: 'What kind of man is Abdullah ibn Salam among you?' They replied: 'He is our master and the son of our master, our scholar and our wise man.' When they finished their praises, I came out before them and said to them: 'O assembly of Jews, fear Allah and accept what has come to you!

Indeed, I bear witness that he is the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and I believe in him, affirm him, and recognize him.' They immediately responded: 'You lied!' Then they began to revile me. I then said to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): 'Did I not tell you, O Messenger of Allah, that they are a slanderous people, treacherous, liars, and corrupt!'
